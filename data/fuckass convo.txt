[[So you just took it and ran?
HIM! I took HIM and ran. It's a dog, not a thing.
Whatever. That's straight-up stealing.
I'd beg to differ.
What would you call it then?
A rescue operation.
You 'rescued' a chihuahua from a retired old lady?
She's fifty! So, not really at death's door. And she's not retired, she's running a health insurance scam.
Still, though. You stole her dog.
Rescued. She's overfeeding him. Carl looks like a plump football.
The dog's name is 'Carl?'
Yeah, so?
You can't give a regular human-sounding name to a pet!
Why not?
I mean, it sounds ridiculous! 'Meet my dog carl and my cat anna!" come on.
Anyway, Carl will be better off with another family.
So... what, you're gonna adopt him anyway?
I'm gonna put him on a diet first.
And then what? What about the serial number tattoo, or microchip?
Shit! I didn't think about that.
Planning to do some ad-hoc surgery on the poor bastard on your kitchen table?
Of course not! That's sick!
So what're you gonna do then?
I'll have to pay some veterinarian under the table!
You teling me you're gonna track down some shady black-market Doctor Doolittle?
I guess so... 'cause I ain't bringing Carl back to my old neighbor.
What if she calls the cops?
That boat... has already sailed.
Are you kidding me?!
No, there was a uniformed cop at our door the other day.
Jesus! Aren't you scared you're gonna get busted?
Nah, I don't think a missing dog is high up on their list.
You're probably right. The police got their hands full already.
Damn straight! High-stakes violent robberies, gangs? They're probably busy.
Speaking of crimes, I think we got some Asian wise guys coming.
'Asian wise guys?' You mean triads?
'Triads? What's 'triads?'
Chinese mafia.
Oh, yeah, that.
Asian wise guys is a weird way of putting it.
Why?
The expression 'Asian wise guys' is an American-Italian mob... thing.
Wait a minute, just a minute you said 'Chinese mafia.' Isn't that juist as weird in that case?
Oh... yeah. Okay, you win that one.
As I was saying, I think we got some people from the... 'triads' in this building.
O-kay, I'll bite, why do you think that?
I've seen a bunch of Chinese dudes here with extensive ink.
They've got tattoos, so what?
Tattoos are given more common in Hong Kong, sure, but unless there's a tattoo convention, these guys are triad members.
How do you know they're from Hong Kong?
Mostly guessing. There's organized crime in big cities, and Cantonese is the main dialect in Hong Kong.
What? How... how the hell do you know that?
Way back, I dated a girl from Hong Kong for a couple of years. I picked up a thing or two.
Oh yeah! Back in college, right? That exchange student?
Yep. Anyway, I think we got some triad members in this place.
What was her name again?
What?
The girl from Hong Kong! what was her name?
Why do you wanna know that?
It's not an odd question!
It kind of is.
No it isn't! If you talk about someone, asking for their name isn't weird.
Her name... isn't important.
Why are you so defensive? It's not like I'm gonna track her down in Hong Kong and try to date her.
I... don't like to talk about her, alright? It didn't end well.
See, now I'm curious about that.
Why are you so goddamn nosy, huh?
We've known each other for seven years, and you've barely talked about this girl.
Her name is Meijing, okay?
And?
No way. If you want the full rundown, you're gonna buy me lots of drinks first.
Deal. Tomorrow night at the Tweaked Edge?
Since you're buying? Sure.
By the way, how long have we been waiting?
Half an hour? Forty-five?
Why do we always show up on time when we know Jake is constantly late?
Cause the few times we have shown up late, he gets wigged out.
Did you text him?
Yteah, ten minutes ago.
What's his excue for being late this time?
Well, he hasn't gotten back to me.
C'mon. That's just a dick move. I'm hungry as hell.
[scoffs] You and me both.
Screw Jake! Let's go and grab some food and meet him at the theater.
Yeah, I'm kinda picking up what you're throwing down here.
What do you wanna eat? Mexican food, maybe?
Nah, I had burritos for lunch yesterday.
What about pizza?
Ehh... too much cheese.
You love cheese! I've seen you stuff your face with double cheese pizza!
I'm trying to get the calories down a bit...
Okay, whatever. What about hamburgers then?
Works for me.
Wheredo you wanna go?
What's the name of that place with the square burgers?
I have no idea, but I don't want 'square burgers'.
What's wrong with square burgers?
Burgers should be round. Otherwise it's some... weird sandwich.
Technically, a burger is a sandwich.
No, it isn't.
Duh, yeah. A burger has to have a cooked and hot filling.
By that definition, a sloppy joe or a grilled cheese is a hamburger.
I misspoke. A hamburger must have a cooked patty of ground meat between the buns.
So if you have a whole piece of chicken or fish between two buns, it doesn't count as a burger?
Nope! Then it's a sandwich.
That's stupid.
Really? Would you classify a philly cheeese steak as a hamburger?
Go to hell!
I'm right, and you know it!
Yeah, yeah... since you don't wany your burger square, where do you wanna go?
Let's go to... Hungry Bob's!
Never heard of it.
It's a new franchise, but they've got awesome burgers. ROUND burgers.
Alright. If Jake doesn't show up soon, we'll go to Hungry Bob's.]]
